``` MYSQL NET REVENUE QUERY

SET sql_mode = '';

	p.purchase_id, 
    p.student_id, 
	CASE

        WHEN p.subscription_type = 2 THEN 'annual'
        WHEN p.subscription_type = 3 THEN 'lifetime'
    END as subscription_type,

    p.refunded_date, 
    min(p.purchase_date) as 'first_purchase_date',

        AND s2.created_date > s1.created_date)

    DATEDIFF(s2.created_date, s1.end_date) > 1

### Findings
---

	*Base on our report , we can conclude that our revenue in October 2022 is 95,982$

	*In April 2020  we had the highest sales as a free long access to the platform due to Covid , to enable students and other clients to update their skills

	*From the bubble chart we see that half of the resurrection comes from subscribers that had an  annual plan instead

	*Base on the revenue by country , we can see that Canada and great Britain has the highest AOv, this means we can target country with highest AOE and offer upgrades during our campaigns .For country that has lower AOV, this means that the price is to high for them , as incentives we can offer special discount for them
